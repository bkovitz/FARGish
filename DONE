Watchers

  Callable objects that take as arguments:
    host graph
    set of nodes in host graph
  and return a list of responses, each of which has:
    salience  (for a random weighted choice of which response to enact)
    action  (function that acts on the host graph)


Accept numble from keyboard


Main loop:
    Run all of a set of watchers

Mustang Sally / Demo 1:
    FoundWanted: avail consumer -- wanted source
    FoundWanted: Declare victory if Avail matches Target
    Watcher for when an Avail Number equals the Target.
    Watcher to combine Avail Numbers.
    'Consume' removes Avail, produces Block.
    Do arithmetic in Python. Actually solve any numble, though crudely.
    Try combining Avail Numbers randomly.
    When there are no Avails and no solution, tag something with Failed.
    Print the graph symbolically, showing the current "thought".
