FARGish/Numbo features and what implements them
-----------------------------------------------


Necker Cube


Search memorized equations by spreading activation


Support network


Salience


Backtracking


Diagnosis and repair


Promisingness


Focus of attention


Expectations and surprise
  Expectations easily assumed true


Expected "path" of solution


Coarse representations
  Coarse "watchers"


Gloms


Scout -> Tester -> Builder


Construct equation by analogy with something else


Spatial representation


Drive by temporal trace
  Many old memories "vote" on how current trace should proceed


"Consume" operation


Don't repeat a Consume with an identical brick


"Proposal" that needs to exceed a threshold of support to run


Visualization of the model's behavior


Analogies without explicit rules (generators)


Promisingness
