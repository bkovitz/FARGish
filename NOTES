Want edge-mate in to-ctx that is bound from from-ctx to a node that links
analogously from from-ctx. Want homomorphism-preserving edge-mate.


Want edge-mate with some intrinsic properties and linking properties.
Can't find node with intrinsic properties? Build one and start continuation
for linking properties. Can find one with intrinsic properties? See if it
violates linking properties. If so, build and k as before. Does it have
all linking properties? Then link to it and we're done. Otherwise link
to it and start continuation for other linking properties.

Not sure what value or class to give a node when building it? Give it a
placeholder.

Incompatible linking properties: already being bound from another node in the
ctx that we are trying to bind from.

Need to monitor nodes with continuations, and keep searching for alternative
mates for desiderata.


When starting an agent, just boost or support an existing agent that matches.


A node has a my-builder port. If the node gets tagged 'failed, it gives
antipathy to its builder. It should give antipathy to any nodes that depend on
its success.
