To run very simple demo of the force-directed graph:

1. In one terminal window, run:

   $ racket web.rkt

2. 


; NEXT
; Code it all "one-off".
;   One-off graph data structure (no generic interface). SORT OF DONE
;   Make a, b, c, nexts, bindings. DONE
;   Check for desiderata.
;   Start tag-scouts for bindings that lack desiderata.
;   Tag-scout code.
;   Assign strength of basis depending on tag(s).
;   Boost support.
;   Decay self-support.
;   Normalize support.
;   Prune nodes with low support.
