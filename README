5-Dec-2019
  Now in the middle of rewriting the do_timestep and Response code.
  The new way has a mix-in object, TimeStepper, which will replace
  NumboGraph.do_timestep() and its ancillary functions. Watcher is now
  ActiveNode and Response is now Action. The new files are:
     bases.py             ActiveNode and Action
     TimeStepper.py
     testTimeStepper.py   Has simple example of setting up a tiny FARG model
