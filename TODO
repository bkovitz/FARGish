Main pieces of FARGish/Numbo still to be done


Pass ModelWrapper an argument specifying which model to run.

    A unit test for ModelWrapper.

Remove all obsolete versions of numbo and numbo classes.


Numbo

    Minus

    See appropriate operator first.

        Fine-grained glomming.

    Memorized addition and multiplication tables.

    See 40, 50; invoke 4+5=9.



Document how FARGish works.

    Support network.


FARGish features

    One-shot active nodes (self-delete upon run).

    Some minimal type-checking.
        A function where an action is expected should return an Action.

    Sequenced neighbors/groups, such as for operands of Minus.

    "non-unique" modified for Node classes (so already_built always returns
    False).


Visualization

    Align like nodes horizontally.

    Turn on/off display of whole types of nodes.
