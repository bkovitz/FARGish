MODEL

    Focal point: search only nodes "near" this, but possibly consider nodes
    (e.g. in the slipnet or long-term memory) that are far away.

    Watchers should be nodes in the graph.

        Wanted should be a watcher. It becomes more salient if its taggee
        heats up.

    Follow old temporal traces.

    It shouldn't be necessary to think through the movement of Avail tags
    carefully. If something goes wrong with those tags, the model itself
    should correct it.


IMPLEMENTATION

    Find some way for watchers like CloseNumbersTagger to not need to
    look at all the Number nodes.
