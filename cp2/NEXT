    Need a way to print out useful debugging information so you can see each
    stage of creating the DetPainters. We really need to see a trace showing
    what called what.

        Match reverse painters: [3,5,succ] should work the same as [5,3,pred].

    CellContent1

Auto-paint Start and End.  DONE

It should be possible for an Index2 to include an Annotation or AnnotationType.

Check for something like Anchor.NoAnnotation. This should match a cell that
has neither Start nor End.
