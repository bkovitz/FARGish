"Determinate" means "all constants, no variables".


PAINTERS

(source, target, function)

The source evaluates to an index, leaving also a Subst with I as this index.
The target evaluates to an index, take the Subst as another input, and
leaving another Subst, with J as this index.
The function evaluates to f, taking the last Subst as input. f can then be
run on canvas(src).

(1, 2, 'j')    absolute painter with constant function
(3, 5, succ)   absolute painter with ordinary function
((I, I+2, same), WS, (I, I+1, 'j'))   'between' painter
               sees a painter, paints a painter in relation to it
(MatchContent('b'), I+1, 'c')    a relative painter
(MatchContent(CellBundle('c'; Inextreme)), WorkingSoup, (I, I+-1, pred))

ADDRS (SOURCES AND TARGETS)

2   an absolute canvas address, i.e. an index
addr+addr
Variable
(src, trg, func)   a painter, possibly matched with variables  (I, I+2, F)
MatchContent(x)    sets I to the location of x
WorkingSoup    store the result in the WorkingSoup; required if func returns a painter

Addrs that appear only in the LTS:

   RelatedPair(I, J, F)   funds two cells related by a known func; sets I, J, F in subst
   TwoAdjacentLetters     records juxtaposition of arbitrary letters


FUNCS (3rd ARGUMENT TO PAINTER)

succ
pred
same
'j'    constant function: ignore the source letter
(I, I+1, succ)   evaluate I and create a new painter, e.g. (2, 3, succ)
MakeBetweenPainter(I, J, F)     makes a painter that paints inside the span of another painter
MakeRelativeIndirectPainter(I, J, F)  makes painter that matches content at I, recreating
   spatial relationship with J, with func F. In effect, goes from constants (for indices)
   to variables.
MirrorOf

Funcs that appear only in the LTS; ab initio painters:

   MakeDigraphPainters
   (I, J, F)              Makes a painter corresponding to RelatedPair.

NOTES

run_pons():  Tries to solve 'abc->abd; ijk->?'. Not a chance. Need to explain
why it has no chance.

Fixed-length canvas.


run('a   ', ['abcd'])
   Regenerates 'abcd'.
run('a   ', ['abce'])
   Regenerates only 'abc '. Why not 'e', given the End annotation?
