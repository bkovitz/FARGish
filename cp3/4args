NEW IDEA: Give every painter four arguments: two values and two addresses.
Every canvas-painter is a painter-cluster. Painters like Succ deal with
just two arguments at a time. Variables exist only within painter-clusters.
They are the "plugs" that connect them to other things in the workspace.
Internally, the plugs are connected through cables and functions, just like
an analog computer.

For example:

    P1=CPainter(L1, L2, I1, I2)
        Succ(L1, L2)
        Succ(I1, I2)
