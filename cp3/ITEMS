Items to go into the "cp2" chapter in the dissertation


CHAPTER HIGHLIGHTS

*** Main concept for chapter?  Predicates & completions ***

It's called the "chunky" model because it paints more than once cell at a
time.

We thought a lot about how to do 'iijjkk' and 'wyz'.

p1,p2,p3,p4,p5: a representation for ajaqb that ultimately fails for doing
variations like 'a   b   a'

No constants as arguments; only variables.

Just pick a few interesting ideas, like predicates & completions, and
leave the rest for cp6. Many are in cp6. Introduce as few of those here as
possible.

A custom Succ operation?  Maybe omit

The diff operation: yields how to make this from that. A delta.

Two ways to represent 'aaabac'
                       aaa bac
                       aa ab ac

Failure tags?

Something we got stuck on: referring to the Length attr of a canvas. How do
you paint *that*?

4-argument painters?
