What are the main ideas of the canvas-and-painters model?




What is the main conclusion?

   Cascading design: Small changes to the genotype can result in large,
   coordinated changes to the phenotype, enabling progressively increasing
   evolvability. 

   A new item added to the workspace can match with many rules, creating new
   workspace items, which can match with more rules--a cascade.

   A way to frame the main conclusion: analogies work by _____.

   Analogies work by re-running a generator for something known, on something
   partly known. A generator is something that can reproduce the whole given
   some of the parts. The generator fills "blanks" in the partly known thing.

   abc->abd; ijk -> ?

   From abc->abd, we make a generator (painters) that can reconstruct abc->abd
   from ab_->abd, a__->a_d, and many other partial versions. We also make a
   generator for the difference, i.e. the "arrow" function. We can reconstruct
   that difference (?) or at least re-run it on 'ijk'.

   Analogy give you a head start on a new domain, by exploiting your knowledge
   of similar relations in a familiar domain. Similar relations exist across
   many domains; this is why analogy-making is important and valuable.

   Locking on to familiar relations in a new domain *orients* you. Orientation
   enables you to navigate the new domain. Disorientation means you can only
   stumble around.
