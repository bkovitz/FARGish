abc -> cba
S1     S2


1. Repetition detector:   'abc'
   R1=Repeat(S1, D1, F1)
   D1=Seed(L1, K1)
   L1='a'
   K1=1       a relative address
   F1=Succ

2. Repetition detector:   'cba'
   R2=Repeat(S2, D2, F2)
   D2=Seed(L2, K2)
   L2='c'
   K2=1
   F2=Pred

   This is not so good. We want to perceive the mirror relation. To get that,
   we need the seed to be the same for both repeaters but the direction to be
   opposite.

3. Detector:
   Q1=Same(I1, J1)
   I1=S1/3
   J1=S2/1
   Leftmost(S2, J1)
   Rightmost(S1, I1)

   Now how does this lead to seeing a mirror relation? The Mirror detector
   has to see this, and maybe at the same time see the Succ/Pred relation.
