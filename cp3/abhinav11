NEW IDEAS

1. Replace Snippets with Spans.

2. Maybe limit the model to Copycat problems.

2a. Maybe implement some memory stuff and in the dissertation tell why it
doesn't work.


PROBLEMS THAT REMAIN TO BE SOLVED       *-optional

1. How to set the length of an empty/unknown canvas/snippet.

2*. How to detect and rebuild a mirror-image relationship.

*. How to make the model be hackable for gradual improvements.


HOW TO SET THE LENGTH OF A CANVAS

- Succ applied to canvas length
- Parameter address to refer to canvas length
- Clusters can be clustered into larger clusters

p1=Cluster(...)  updates letters
p2=Cluster(...)  updates length
p12=Cluster(...)  combines p1 and p2
