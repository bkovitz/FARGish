AGENDA

1. Figure out what each edge represents.
2. Identify the basis of thinking that cycles matter.
3. What rules determine placing edges and deciding whether a cycle is good?


WHY ARE CYCLES IN ANALOGIES GOOD?

Because cycles describe attractors in an update process. That's how it worked
in the Hopfield net. But in c&p, we don't have painters altering canvas cells
back and forth. What sort of attractor is there in the dynamics of c&p?

Snippets never change (more than once), but the final canvas changes as
snippets get more and less weight. Is there any attractor for the final
canvas and the weights of the snippets? The main concern is the final canvas;
the snippet weights affect it.

What makes a snippet's weight change? Perhaps "repainting" occurs in the form
of occasional repeated spreading activation, where high-clarity snippets and
cells (like the given letters) cause activation to flow to painters that
read from them as arguments, or, better yet, paint them correctly.

   In cp1, a painter that reads from a high-clarity cell and writes to a
   low-clarity cell has high probability of running.


coherence => stability

stability is the sine qua non of analogy



clarity <=> stability ?


Hyp.: People dislike instability as such. So, the mere recognition that an
idea is unstable is enough to make people flee it.
