ABSORPTION

1. Repetition detector:
   R1=Repeat(S1, D1, F1, E1)
   S1=Snippet(S0, SP1)
   SP1=Span(1, 3)    Is this a good idea?
   D1=Seed(L1, I1)
   L1='a'
   I1=1      relative index
   F1=Same
   E1=Exception(G1, I2)
   G1=Insert(L2)
   L2='j'
   I2=2

2. Repetition detector:
   R2=Repeat(S2, D2, F2, E2)
   S2=Snippet(S0, SP2)
   SP2=Span(3, 5)
   D2=Seed(L3, I3)
   L3='a'
   I3=1
   F2=Succ
   E2=Exception(G2, I4)
   G2=Insert(L4)
   L4='q'
   I4=2

3. Detect the overlap between S1 and S2, and make this painter via the 'diff'
   process.
   R3=Cluster(RR1, RR2, SS1, SS2, DD, FF1, FF2, EE1, EE2, GG1, GG2, LL1, LL2,
              II1, II2)
      RR1=Repeat(SS1, DD, FF1, EE1)
      RR2=Repeat(SS2, DD, FF2, EE2)
      Overlap(SS1, SS2)    <-- the only painter??
      FF1=Same
      FF2=Succ
      EE1=Exception(GG1, II1)
      GG1=Insert(LL1)
      LL1='j'
      II1=2
      EE2=Exception(GG2, II2)
      GG2=Insert(LL2)
      LL2='q'
      II2=2

   R3 means "If you give me an analog of R1, I'll give you an analog of R2
   (or vice versa)."

REGENERATION   from 'a____'
                    T0

4. R1's detector sees 'a__' and fires, creating R1':
   R1'=Repeat(T1, D1, F1, E1)
   T1=Snippet(T0, SP3)
   SP3=Span(1, 3)

5. R2's detector sees 'a__' and fires, creating R2':
   R2'=Repeat(T2, D2, F2, E2)
   T2=Snippet(T0, SP4)
   SP4=Span(1, 3)

6. SOMEHOW choose to run R3 on R1'. Then R3(RR1=R1') creates this painter:
   R2''=Repeat(T3, D1, F3, E3)
   T3=Snippet(T0, SP5)
   SP5=Span(3, 5)
   F3=Succ
   E3=Exception(G3, I5)
   G3=Insert(L5)
   L5='q'
   I5=2

   R3 must create the Overlap painter and leave it in the workspace to retain
   the relation between snippets T1 and T3. We need that Overlap relation in
   order to track cycles.

7. R1' runs, filling snippet T1. T1 projects into the final canvas, producing:
   'aja__'.

8. R2' runs, filling snippet T2. T2 gives us two competing snippets for the
   first three cells of the final canvas:
   'aja__'
   'aqa__'

9. R2'' runs, filling snippet T3. T3 is linked to T1, so they together form
   this final canvas:
   'ajaqb'

10. SOMEHOW R3 decides to run on R2'.
   QUESTION: How do we know which parameter to fill with R2'?
      Idea #1: Track with a BasedOn tag that RR2 was originally R2.
      Idea #2: R3 will fail unification if run with RR1=R2', because
      R2'.op â‰  Same. R3.FF1=Same but R2'.op=Succ.
   Then R3(RR2=R2') creates the following:
   R1''=Repeat(T-1, D1, F4, E4)
   Snippet T-1 fails because it's off the left edge of the main canvas.

   What happens if the model tries to extend the canvas? Will there still be
   broken cycles of painters, as in the version without clusters?

11. Since R3(RR2=R2') failed, there's nothing left to do.

Did cycles emerge? Yes. But now instead of the 'image-of' or BasedOn relation,
R2 and R2'' are related by the fact that
