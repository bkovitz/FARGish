Each proto-painter needs a set of criteria for what it takes to be complete.

A painter is complete when the model has all the information needed to run
the painter somewhere other than where it was made, i.e. changing one its
arguments and blanking the other.

It appears that since some painters are complete when they start, we don't
get a quadratic explosion of metapainters.


Same(addr, addr)
   Needs relation between addrs. (Because Same is a value relation.)
Same(op, op)
   Complete. (Because we don't know about relations between predicates. Or
   do we? What about Succ-Pred, the "mirror" relation?)

OtherHandSameIndex(addr, addr)
   Complete. (Because OtherHandSameIndex is a relative spatial relation:
   OtherHandSameIndex can construct addr1 from any new addr2 and vice versa.)

OtherSide(addr, addr)
   Complete. (Because OtherSide is a relative spatial relation.)

Repeat(addr, start, op)
   Needs source outside addr for start.
   Needs painter for op (unless op was taken from source).
   Needs painter for addr.

Copy(letter, addr)
   Needs source for letter?
   Needs painter for addr.





   a1=a(x, y)
   b1=b(a'(x), a'(y))
   c1=c(b(a'(x), b(a'(y))
