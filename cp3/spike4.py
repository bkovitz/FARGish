 Have -> need

 Have @J, need J   PaintValue('a')

 Paint object:
     Have PaintValue, need PaintAt.

p1 = ws.make_painter_from([Apart, Same], [(I, 1), (J, 3)])
p2 = ws.make_painter_from(
    [Inside, FilledWith],
    [(P, p1), (K, 2), (L, Letter('j'))]
)

a____
Loop I through all indices but last:
p1.complete(ws, Subst.make_from([(I, 1)]) should= Paint(3, Letter('a'))
    Same can build from I but needs a J
    Apart, given I, can make a J
    Same, given @I, can make @J
Now put p1 into ws.  {a_a__ p1}
Loop P through all painters in the ws:
p2.complete(ws, Subst.make_from([(P, p1)])) should= Paint(2, Letter('j'))
    FilledWith can build @K but needs a K
    Inside, given P.span, can make a K
    FilledWith, given K, can make @K
Now put p2 into ws.  {aja__ p1 p2}
Loop P through all painters:
p5.complete(ws, Subst.make_from([(P, p2)])) should= MakePainter(p4, ...)
    SameSpatialRelation given P, can make Q.spatial_relation
    ConsecutiveSpans given P, can make Q  (but it will lack a span)
                                       Q.requires_consecutive(P, Q)
Incomplete[p4'] needs a span
    p3.Apart can make a span and p4' needs a p3 mate
    Apart, to make a span, needs I,J
    ConsecutiveSpans can judge whether p2.I,J and p4'.I,J are consecutive
        ^ This is tricky. We need to make fresh variables I1,J1,I2,J2 to
          pass to ConsecutiveSpans to check every possibility.


p5.complete(ws, Subst.make_from([(P, p2)])) should= MakePainter(based_on=p4, WillHave(THIS.spatial_relation), WillHave(ConsecutiveSpan(p2, THIS)))
    p4 = P=p3, K=4
    
Incomplete[p4'] is built. {aja__ p1 p2 Incomplete[p4']}
Inside[P],FilledWith[K,L],L='q'
Need: P.span,K,ConsecutiveSpan(p2,THIS)

Problem: We need P.span, but P does not exist. How can we tell that P must be created, and based on p3?
The answer must come from the Subst or AnchorAttributes of p4.

Need P. No predicate holds P. The painter object itself must offer a method that, given nothing, can return a Painter.

When we start running a complete painter, it has one anchor and needs one anchor.
When we start completing an incomplete painter, we look to find or construct both its anchors.
The anchors of Incomplete[p4'] are P,K.  The reason we call it incomplete is because it doesn't even have one anchor yet.
We must base any new constructed anchor on a WillHave attribute.

To paint a canvas cell, what do we need?
  Index
  Value

To build a new painter, what do we need?
  I,J painter:       P,K painter:      P,Q painter:
  LeftIndex          OtherPainter      FirstPainter
  RightIndex         Index             SecondPainter
  SpatialRelation    SpatialRelation   PainterRelation
  ValueRelation      ValueRelation     PainterRelation

When completing Incomplete[p4'], we need:
    OtherPainter    ->  get a template for it from p4
    Index           ->  will get it from p3' once p3' is built
    SpatialRelation ->  Inside  (from WillHave, provided by SameSpatialRelation)
    ValueRelation   ->  get it from p4'  (FilledWith)

    FilledWith will need K  ->  get it from p3' once p3' is built
    FilledWith will need L  ->  get it from p4
    Inside will need P      ->  get a template for it from p4
    Inside will need P.span ->

    To construct p3', we need:
        LeftIndex        -> somehow ConsecutiveSpan must provide it
        RightIndex       -> somehow ConsecutiveSpan must provide it
        SpatialRelation  -> Apart (from template)
        ValueRelation    -> Succ (from template)

        To construct a span, we need:
            LeftIndex
            RightIndex
        So, we might create a span with only a LeftIndex, and have yet another
        completion process to find the RightIndex.


IDEA: The Workspace could be a big soup of objects, some of which are complete and
some of which are incomplete. Every timestep, we pick an incomplete object and try
to do the next step of completing it.

NEXT: Work the same examples as always through the above idea.
        


"What can you make from an X?"
    We call this while painting, or seeing if you can paint.
"Who can make a Y?"
    We call this while painting or completing, once some part of painting
    or completing has begun. If one predicate has produced something, and
    another predicate needs something, then we call this.
"Who can judge X,Y?"
    If you can judge X,Y, then you can produce a valid X,Y combination if we
    pass you all the possible X,Ys.
A condition: every predicate within a painter must contribute something before
the painter can act.

Usually if one predicate produced something, we ask only other predicates of
the same painter if they can use it.

Are there times when we want one painter to supply something that another
painter needs? Possibly yes: when we are constructing or completing painters.
If a painter P<pA needs something that pB can provide, then we might try
building Q<pB as a stage in completing P. E.g. when p4' needs a span, we
build p3' to provide it. Perhaps if one painter needs a snippet that another
painter can paint, we build the other painter and let it paint the snippet.

Apart must have the ability to make a span, but building a span doesn't
count as painting. Perhaps name these 'informational' methods differently,
or wrap their return value in a different type. Completion[RightIndex] vs.
Info[Span].


So, we have multiple types of completion elements:

1. ActionElements, which help specify an Action that will alter the Workspace,
i.e. will alter the Canvas or the set of Painters.

2. InfoElements, which help choose a method or supply arguments to a method
that will produce an ActionElement or another InfoElement.

3. Actions are themselves completions of Painters.


Are there "primal" Painters, to generate new painters from already complete
relations noticed in the Workspace? How would we specify one? If a compound
relation has been spotted in one place, it should be easier to spot it in
another place--suggesting that perhaps the model should make new "primal"
painters dynamically.

Given I,J,Predicate, give Detection.
Given two Detections, give Painter.

Can we make new Predicates dynamically? Apart(D=3)?

If we learn abc->abd, it should be easy to see that again. We should, in
effect, build up an "interpreter" for some virtual machine of painters.
(Still a vague idea.)


If we represent the Workspace as nothing but a big soup of canvas cellâ€“value
pairs and painters, then we can do like Mathematics SubsetReplace to keep
updating it. Then maybe c&p will be like a term-rewriting system.

Can we prove that this system always reaches an attractor? Can we disprove it?


Can we use a notion of "p4' is like p4 but with these arguments" or "p4' is
like p4 but with this override"?


We have some notion of an Index and a Thing At That Index. Can a Thing be a
snippet? A sequence of letters? A painter? A collection of painters?


What we need next: The ability to figure out what we have, so we can ask
what can build on it, and the ability to figure out what we need, so we can
ask to build it.
