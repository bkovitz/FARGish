Suppose that we mostly refer to indices via tags, like Rightmost, Leftmost,
Salient, The(letter), The(Oddball). Then a common process should go like this:

   1. painter refers to something by tag
   2. nothing in the relevant context has that tag
   3. some other process looks for something to give that tag to
   4. something in the relevant context gets the tag
   5. the painter re-runs, this time successfully


Opposite(tag)

Let's look at seeds for repeaters.

'abc'
S1

Repeat(S1, Seed('a', _), Succ, .dir=LeftToRight)
Repeat(S1, Seed('c', _), Pred, .dir=RightToLeft)
