    Provide a way to override the fields in a Codelet?

        Complexes?

        "Modify" something deep inside a complex: it should cascade out.
        (Need example.)

    Upon painting, save the overwritten cell contents to the ws.

        And also upon erasing.

    A Workspace class.

        Put a complex in, and all its subcomplexes become nodes, too.

    Put a + into ca[1] and let the model get it operands from the avails
    in ca[0].

    Put 4+4 into ca[1] and recover.

    Look up Consumers from the slipnet.



    

    Maybe:

        When making a variant, such as varying the Operator in a Consumer,

        Store Equations in the slipnet, and convert them to Consumers.

            Convert Equation(9 + 6 = 15) to Consumer(15 - 6 = 9).

Other things

    Query slipnet to resolve snags.

        Make some codelets to resolve snags.

    Overriding/varying Agent arguments.

    Output slipnet as a dot graph?

Seeing what's happening

    Decent logging.  DONE

        With auto-indent.  DONE

    ActivationLog.see(): plot, pr, and input('key...').  DONE

    Some nice way to show Detectors in the log, so that when Detectors don't
    see anything, nothing is shown, but when a Detector fires and runs codelets,
    you can see both the codelets and the Detector responsible.

    Some nice way to periodically see just the main canvas or the whole
    workspace in the log, e.g. once every 10 timesteps.

    util.lpts():  Like pts() but goes to logfile.

    Logging for 'NOFIZZLE': when an Agent runs its Codelets and there is
    no Fizzle. (Not the same as 'succeeded'.)

    Animate spreading activation with one keystroke per step, showing a
    specified set of nodes of interest, making the nodes and edges larger to
    show activations and SentA's. Maybe show Deltas with a little triangle next
    to the nodes.

    tla= "Time last acted" in FARGModel.pr for Agents

    Easy way to see timeseries of Slipnet queries.

    Easy way to see timeseries of Workspace spreading activation.

    Easy way to see the graph in the Workspace.

Small things

    Refactor 'Sources' -> NameCtx.

    Make a lo() function to log a string at the current indent level.

        lo(Any, ...) to always print?  lo(Something, ...) to print only if
        logging Something is enabled?

    with logging_of(...) to turn logging of certain things on within the block.

    Make trace follow the same Indent as logging.

    Give the() a generic return type.

    short() to print short strings  DONE

    Construct Consumer(6x5) from the string 'Consumer(6x5)'.

    Make a standard short() for dataclasses that prints shorts of all the
    fields.

        But for Agents, it should omit the AgentState fields.

    When logging a Codelet, don't print behalf_of if that Agent is being
    logged. This will make logs more readable.

    Maybe: Dereference refs in Codelet .run() args before calling .run()
    This would make the log more informative. See the mess currently
    showing for QuerySlipnetForDelegate.

    Classes with nice __str__ functions for predicates returned by as_pred()
    and ws_pred().

Exciting things

    Record the current context with a desired codelet, and get that codelet
    to be triggered when the same context recurs.

Nice things

    Write step-by-step instructions for how to make a new Agent, a new
    Codelet, and a new Detector.

StackOverflow questions

    How to annotate "Any Hashable except None". ALREADY ANSWERED: Can't be done.

    Why doesn't this work?

        @dataclass(frozen=True)
        class Not:
            pred: CallablePred

            def __call__(self: Not, x: Any) -> bool:
                return not self.pred(x)  # type: ignore[operator]  # mypy bug?

    Is there an easy way to construct a single object from a class plus mix-ins,
    without declaring a new class for it?

        Maybe via the 'type' function!

    Need deterministic hash code for class objects.
