Seeing what's happening

    Decent logging.  DONE

        With auto-indent.  DONE

    Animate spreading activation with one keystroke per step, showing a
    specified set of nodes of interest, making the nodes and edges larger to
    show activations and SentA's. Maybe show Deltas with a little triangle next
    to the nodes.

    Easy way to see timeseries of Slipnet queries.

    Easy way to see timeseries of Workspace spreading activation.

    Easy way to see the graph in the Workspace.

Small things

    Make a lo() function to log a string at the current indent level.

        lo(Any, ...) to always print?  lo(Something, ...) to print only if
        logging Something is enabled?

    Make trace follow the same Indent as logging.

    Give the() a generic return type.

    short() to print short strings  DONE

    Construct Consumer(6x5) from the string 'Consumer(6x5)'.

    Make a standard short() for dataclasses that prints shorts of all the
    fields.

        But for Agents, it should omit the AgentState fields.

    When logging a Codelet, don't print behalf_of if that Agent is being
    logged. This will make logs more readable.

    Maybe: Dereference refs in Codelet .run() args before calling .run()
    This would make the log more informative. See the mess currently
    showing for QuerySlipnetForDelegate.

    Classes with nice __str__ functions for predicates returned by as_pred()
    and ws_pred().

Exciting things

    Record the current context with a desired codelet, and get that codelet
    to be triggered when the same context recurs.


StackOverflow questions

    How to annotate "Any Hashable except None". ALREADY ANSWERED: Can't be done.

    Why doesn't this work?

        @dataclass(frozen=True)
        class Not:
            pred: CallablePred

            def __call__(self: Not, x: Any) -> bool:
                return not self.pred(x)  # type: ignore[operator]  # mypy bug?

    Is there an easy way to construct a single object from a class plus mix-ins,
    without declaring a new class for it?
