(set-union) won't take zero arguments. Why not return empty set?

(#%app f arg . optarg) won't compile. This makes it hard to write a macro
that forwards arguments to a function definition.



Why I've usually found Racket agonizing to program in, even though it's really
good and I get results:

1. The documentation. It's great about syntax, but it's missing how to *use*
libraries (so using them is like solving a jigsaw puzzle without the picture)
and semantics are often not spelled out clearly and directly. I'm constantly
guessing and doing "primary research" on the libraries.

2. Debugging. How do you find out what's happening in a program? Half the time
I'm guessing what the semantics and intended way of use is, so I have to
debug. Stacktraces are often hard to get; line-number information is often
missing. What function called what? What arguments were on the stack?

3. SLOW. The frequent, unpredictable pauses interfere with my train of
thought.


An example of an error message that omits crucial information:
. Type Checker: type mismatch
  expected: srcloc
  given: Any in: (quote blah)

What thing was supposed to be of type srcloc?


Stuff to go into a Racket cookbook
----------------------------------

Suppose that you have a syntax-parse macro with a #:with. How do you move the
#:with to a function (or something) so you can call it from two macros? (See
fizzle.rkt.)

For example, I started with this:
     #:with srcloc-expr (quasisyntax/loc #'nodeclass
                          (srcloc '#,(syntax-source #'nodeclass)
                                  '#,(syntax-line #'nodeclass)
                                  '#,(syntax-column #'nodeclass)
                                  '#,(syntax-position #'nodeclass)
                                  '#,(syntax-span #'nodeclass)))
and changed it to this (inside begin-for-syntax) after a few attempts:
  (define (srcloc-expr stx)
    #`(srcloc '#,(syntax-source stx)
              '#,(syntax-line stx)
              '#,(syntax-column stx)
              '#,(syntax-position stx)
              '#,(syntax-span stx)))
Am I missing an obviously right way to do it?
