abcd -> abcde; pqr -> ?
S1      S2     S3     S4


1. Repetition detector:   'abcd'
   R1=Repeat(S1, D1, F1)
   D1=Seed(L1, I1)
   L1='a'
   I1=1       a relative address
   F1=Succ

2. Repetition detector:   'abcde'
   R2=Repeat(S2, D2, F2)
   D2=Seed(L2, I2)
   L2='a'
   I2=1       a relative address
   F2=Succ

3. Detector for '->': we search for sameness and difference between R1 and R2.
   Arrow(RR1, RR2,
   RR1=Repeat(args)
   RR2=Repeat(args)
   Same(RR1, RR2)   <-- wrong: R1.snippet â‰  R2.snippet

   We find that we don't need a painter-cluster here.

4. Detector for '->': we search for a relation between S1 and S2.
   Arrow(SS1, SS2, RR, NN1, NN2)=
   SS1=Snippet(.length=NN1, .filled_by=RR)
   SS2=Snippet(.length=NN2, .filled_by=RR)
   Succ(NN1, NN2)

   CONCLUSION: Painters need named arguments. Specifications of painters in
   clusters should be able to refer to some of a painter's arguments and not
   need to specify all. If a cluster constructs a partial object, it can be
   completed by some other element later.

   CONCLUSION: The Arrow painter should relate snippets, not repeaters.
   DOUBT: This was based on the mistaken conclusion that R1 and R2 are the
   same. Im fact, their .snippet arguments are different.

   Should we have a Same painter inside Arrow?
