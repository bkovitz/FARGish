NEW IDEAS

1. Replace Snippets with Spans.

2. Maybe limit the model to Copycat problems.

2a. Maybe implement some memory stuff and in the dissertation tell why it
doesn't work.


PROBLEMS THAT REMAIN TO BE SOLVED       *-optional

1. How to set the length of an empty/unknown canvas/snippet.

2*. How to detect and rebuild a mirror-image relationship.

*. How to make the model be hackable for gradual improvements.


HOW TO SET THE LENGTH OF A CANVAS

- Succ applied to canvas length
- Parameter address to refer to canvas length
- Clusters can be clustered into larger clusters

p1=Cluster(...)  updates letters
p2=Cluster(...)  updates length
p12=Cluster(...)  combines p1 and p2

Choices for today:

-  Read about Knuth-Bendix.  DONE
-  Work out the reduction rules fully.
   - CANVAS_RELATION  DONE
   - DETPAINTER: do determinate painters get into the ws and terms? Yes. DONE
-  Plan out how to implement the reduction rules.
-  Work out the cycle/attractor.


a2 - b2 = (a + b)(a - b)

WHAT REMAINS TO GET TO IJL

Enter all the remaining rules, including for SeqSkip

Diff two repeaters: make a painter that, given one repeater, can make the
other, specifically by adding or removing Skip.

   Seq, SeqSkip, CANVAS_RELATION -> AddException
   Seq, SeqSkip, CANVAS_RELATION -> Difference

Notice that Difference could fill c4.

Run the Difference to create the repeater for c4.

Run the repeater, filling c4.

Notice cycle, indicating that the run is done.


18-May-2023

Work through examples of latest rules+wholes.

Seq vs. Span. Does one of these lock on to specific indices in the canvas?

Seq/Span vs. Run.


19-May-2023

1. Finish one or two more examples.

2. Let's see what rules/wholes/software capabilities are needed to go from
stage to stage in the current set of examples.

3. What could I write about when I'm too groggy to program or think through
examples?


22-May-2023

1. Do another example with stages only, if needed.

2. Settle Span vs. Chunk vs. Seq.

3. Work out the Rules that go from one stage to the next.
