cactus  -->   how to water a cactus

f needs to act differently on a tomato than a cactus: it must water the tomato more.

We don't need g, because we don't need a function that takes 'tomato' as input and returns 'cactus'.

But we do need to transform f so that it puts a different amount of water on a cactus than on a tomato.

Does this prove that we need a system that can take functions as input and return functions? Does analogy require
operating on functions to transplant them from one domain to another?

Does h take two arguments--f and (tomato, cactus)?


Indexicals make it so you can use the same f in both worlds. An indexical function needs to be able to find elements in
the New World that can serve as functions for it to call there. These functions correspond to the functions called by
the indexical in the Old World?


g(f)   

cactus -> blind search to find the closest thing to cactus (g-1)

f1: tomato->w.tomato
f2: baobab->w.baobab
f3: car->clean.car

fx: cactus->w.cactus

ti find fx - we do a blind search -> fx = g1(f1), fx = g2(f2), fx = g3(f3)
   fx = g1(f1)



f = a composed with b


We need to cook up an f' to suit the New World. There can be no a priori way of doing this. This is the difference
between analogy and logic. Analogy's job is to start your guesses in fruitful territory.

When applying your knowledge of how to water a tomato to figure out how to water a cactus, you start by expecting that
you should pour water into the ground near the cactus. You never think that you should light a match and set the cactus
on fire.



To find f', you exploit your knowledge of the difference between a tomato and a cactus. Specifically, you reason that
since a cactus's native environment gets much less water than the tomato's environment, the cactus probably needs less
water than the tomato.


Next:  It would be nice to specify a Length as "the same length as that" when the length is long, like > 3. Or even
"about the same length as that".
