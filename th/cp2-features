Ideas/features in cp2 and why they're in there.


abs painter   Copied from Hopfield net


Absorption is the same as regeneration except:
   Absorption moves WS painters to LTS when done.
   Regeneration can overwrite given letters?


determinate painters: needed because you can match in more than one place


Run until clarities all >= 4.

punishing:  to inhibit painters when they paint a wrong value over a given
letter

Why do we need clarity? What's an example to illustrate it?
Digraphs in 'ajaqb' should get a conflict.


How do we get attractors with cycles? Where are Process A and Process B?


relative indirect painter

digraph painter

No abs painters in LTM

Finish  'a a b'

canvas, letter, blank

address

   absolute address, i.e. index

   letter-match

   painter-match:  (I, J, F)   Plus is allowed

   TwoAdjacentLetters

punishing

clarity

absolute painter

relative painter (digraph)

match on index => cell value is a variable but index is fixed
match on cell value => index is a variable but cell value is fixed

relative indirect painter   ('a', ws, (I, I+2, succ))

paint a painter rather than directly to the canvas so that other painters
can match the painter

cell annotation

   Start, Inextreme, End     Immutable?



CHAIN LINKS   problem => solution  or  solution => problem

? unstable, won't converge => clarity    need example

relative painters write 'q' in cell 2 in 'ajaqb' => punishing

NEXT: Figure out more chain links. Pick an item, see what necessitated it.



EXPERIMENTS TO RUN

See if model converges to a few good answers with punishing on, clarity,
certain ab initio painters, excluding abs painters from LTS, etc.

   WTST attractors don't come into being without certain features, and
   do come into being with those features.

Try perturbing an attractor state by changing a letter.
Variant: just run a seed with only one blank.


OBSERVATIONS

abcabd, ijk___  works
aabbccaabbdd, iijjkk______  works but without grouping

This model doesn't go grouping, and grouping is the greater part of what makes
the letterstring domain interesting.
