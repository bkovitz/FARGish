How can we make a repeater that just sets the length of every subsnippet to 2?
Maybe have two Arrow painters: one is a repeater that copies all the snippets
in sequence, and the other is a repeater that sets the length of each snippet
to 2.

Could we perceive S1 as a flawed S2?


1. Repetition detections:
   R1.1=Repeat(S1.1, Seed('a', 1), Same)
   S1.1=Snippet(inside=S1, span(1, 5))
   R1.2=Repeat(S1.2, Seed('b', 1), Same)
   S1.2=Snippet(inside=S1, span(6, 6))
   R1.3=Repeat(S1.3, Seed('c', 1), Same)
   S1.3=Snippet(inside=S1, span(7, 8))
   R1.4=Repeat(S1.4, Seed('d', 1), Same)
   S1.4=Snippet(inside=S1, span(9, 12))
   R1.5=Repeat(S1.5, Seed('e', 1), Same)
   S1.5=Snippet(inside=S1, span(13, 13))

   Can we make a repeater apply the Succ relationship across all the snippets
   while allowing each to retain its own length?
