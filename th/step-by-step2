   Rule: Run

      We want to match via a variable on the lhs, and create a rhs with variables, not with the constants matched.
      This is the crucial step: changing constants to variables. The lhs matches a noticed relationship; the rhs embodies
      the relationship in a way that can be re-run elsewhere, on different relata.

Seq[Span[N Seq[b b b b]] -> Span[N+1, Seq[b b b b b]] ; Span[3, Seq[b b b]] -> Span[]]
   Rule:

Seq[Span[N, Run[b Succ]] -> Span[N+1, Run[b Succ]] ; Span[3, Run[b Succ]] -> Span[]]

   Rule: Notice that Succ and Succ are the same; replace with OP

Seq[Span[N, Run[L OP]] -> Span[N+1, Run[L OP]] ; Span[3, Run[b Succ]] -> Span[]]

   Now the Old World should partially match the New World and fill in the blank in the New World.

   Seq[Span[N, Run[b Succ]] -> Span[N+1, Run[b Succ]]]
   Seq[Span[3, Run[b Succ]] -> Span[]]]



   Span[N, Run[L OP]] -> Span[N+1, Run[L OP]] ; Span[M Run[L2 OP2]] -> Span[]

   "Fill in the blank, going from Old World to New World."


   Rule: ... TERM[N ...] ... TERM[N+1 ...] ... => ... TERM['N ...] ... TERM['(N+1) ...] ...
   "Change constants to variables if related by +1."

   Seq[A], Seq[Succ[A]] => jkdhfjh

Seq[Span[N, Run[b Succ]] -> Span[N+1, Run[b Succ]]]
Seq[Span[3, Run[b Succ]] -> Span[]]]

   Part-whole matching; the part that matches the blank fills the blank, with the variables replaced by constants.
   So, N=3, N+1=4.

Seq[Span[3, Run[b Succ]] -> Span[4, Run[b Succ]]]


A MAIN IDEA
There are two main match-and-write actions performed by the model:

   Rerepresentation, done by rules.  Match lhs, create rhs.
      Constants to variables
      Items to chunks
   Part-whole completion.          Match some subset, create the missing part.
      Variables to constants
      Blanks to letters, terms.

The model seeks a part-whole completion in which the Old World maps to the New World, enabling completion. This requires
defining appropriate variables and relationships. For some problems, like 'bbbb -> bbbbb; bbb -> ?', this is easy. For
others, it's difficult.

DECISIONS

Should each "whole result" be a representation of the whole Copycat problem, or can we have lots of little, separate terms
representing "noticings"?

What term includes a length, possibly without specifying contents? Or contents without a length? Chunk, Span, Seq

What things are easy to notice? Each of those things should have a rule, which generates a record that the thing was
noticed and where it was noticed.

   Things that are exactly the same.

   Things that are off by one, i.e. Succ and Pred.

Do we need some notion of a relative address? Directions to walk along a graph?

   "The value relation of 4 to 5 (i.e. Succ) should correlate with the spatial relation of where they're placed in their
   context." We need a vocabulary of spatial relations: a way to *specify* a spatial relation, i.e. where one term is
   relative to another, e.g. "in consecutive nodes in the AST graph".

The main reason to introduce a Chunk is to change constants to variables. A variable should occur more than once in a Chunk,
in order to make the Chunk represent a relationship.

Do the variables in a Chunk have scope limited to the Chunk?
   I think so. The variables in a rule have scope limited to the rule.

Should we pull the Chunk out and refer to it from inside the Canvas? Should the model try to name the Chunk in a way that
makes it easy to find when it's relevant?

   Canvas[chunk1[N OP L] ; b b b -> Span[]]
   chunk1[N OP L] = Chunk[Span[Length[N] Run[OP L]] -> Span[Length[N+1] Run[OP L]]]

Is pretty much every term a tag? "This thing has these attributes." "These cells have this representation."

We're rerepresenting over and over until it becomes easy to see one thing "as" another.

bbbb: Span[Length[4] Run[Same b]]
bbbb->bbbbb: Chunk[Span[Length[N] Run[OP L]] -> Span[Length[N+1] Run[OP L]]]

In the genealogy graph, what are the nodes here?

For generating Runs from sequences of letters (or anything else), this could be done in a coarse-grained way and a
fine-grained way. The fine-grained way is to do many small steps, perhaps joining little spans or little runs together,
perhaps starting with "rough-approximation" runs and examining them more closely. The coarse-grained way is to just have
some Python code, like repetition_detector(), which leaps from some letters to a Run term in one step. The quick way to the
Mustang Sally is the coarse-grained way. It can be replaced with the fine-grained way in later experiments.


It should be possible for the model to return ?=bbbbb. How could that happen?

Canvas[b b b b -> b b b b b ; b b b -> Span[]]

Canvas[Span[Length[4] Run[Same b]] -> b b b b b ; b b b -> Span[]]

Canvas[Span[Length[4] Run[Same b]] -> Span[Length[5] Run[Same b]] ; b b b -> Span[]]

Canvas[Chunk[Span[Length[N] Run[Same b]]] -> Span[Length[5] Run[Same b]] ; b b b -> Span[]]

Canvas[Chunk[Span[Length[N] Run[Same b]]] -> Span[Length[5] Run[Same b]] ; Span[Length[3] Run[Same b]] -> Span[]]

Canvas[Chunk[Span[Length[N] Run[Same b]] -> Span[Length[5] Run[Same b]]] ; Span[Length[3] Run[Same b]] -> Span[]]
   extended the Chunk
Canvas[Chunk[Span[Length[N] Run[Same b]] -> Span[Length[5] Run[Same b]]] ; Span[Length[3] Run[Same b]] -> Span[Length[5] Run[Same b]]]
   match the chunk, fill the blank

Instead of introducing variable N for Length[4], when N only occurs once in the Chunk, it might be better to just
loose-match Span[Length[4] Run[Same b]] with Span[Length[3] Run[Same b]].



2. bbbb -> bbbbb; eee -> ?

Canvas[Chunk[Span[Length[N] Run[OP L]] -> Span[Length[N+1] Run[OP L]]] ; Span[Length[3] Run[Same e]] -> Span[]]

Canvas[Chunk[Span[Length[N] Run[OP L]] -> Span[Length[N+1] Run[OP L]]] ; Span[Length[3] Run[Same e]] -> Span[Length[4] Run[Same e]]]

There's really no difference from problem 1.

   N=3 L=p OP=Succ

Perhaps a Chunk means "I'm looking at this now. It can figure into part-whole completions." Chunks might fade out soon if
they aren't used. It might be necessary to Chunk the Span[...]->Span[] at the end before completing the latter.

A Span means "Here are two or more simultaneous descriptions of the same sequence of letters."

The model basically searches for an impedance match among spans/chunks.


5. aaaxa -> aaaaa; qmmmmm -> ?

Canvas[Chunk[Span[Length[N] Run[Same a] Replace[4 x]] -> Span[Length[N] Run[Same a]]] ; Span[Length[6] Run[Same m] Replace[1 q]] -> Span[Length[5] Run[Same[m]]]]
   The trick here is to see that lacking a Replace[] member means to remove it on the rhs of the ->.


A bad line of exploration that the model should be able to make:

Canvas[. . . ; q Span[Length[5] Run[Same m]] -> Span[]]
   resulting eventually in:
Canvas[. . . ; q Span[Length[5] Run[Same m]] -> q m m m m m]

Is it possible that cycle-detection might reject this for poor corresponding structure?


Could we represent this as "regularize the odd letter"?

   saw that mm, pp, tt have the same structure
Canvas[Seq[m p t] -> Span[L=Seq[m p t] Chunk[Span[Length[2] Run[Same L]]]] ; u r i k -> Span[]]
   The model has begun actively looking for things that could be seen as Seq[m p t].
Canvas[Chunk[SEQ=Seq[m p t] SEQ -> Span[L=SEQ Chunk[Span[Length[2] Run[Same L]]]]] ; u r i k -> Span[]]
   saw that Seq[m p t] occurs twice; Chunked the Old World
Canvas[Chunk[SEQ=Seq[m p t] SEQ -> Span[L=SEQ Chunk[Span[Length[2] Run[Same L]]]]] ; Seq[u r i k] -> Span[]]
   put 'urik' into a Seq; seeking analogy
Canvas[Chunk[SEQ=Seq[m p t] SEQ -> Span[L=SEQ Chunk[Span[Length[2] Run[Same L]]]]] ; Seq[u r i k] -> Span[Length[2] Run[Same u]]  Span[Length[2] Run[Same r]]  Span[Length[2] Run[Same i]]  Span[Length[2] Run[Same k]]
   applied the Chunk to the New World
Canvas[Chunk[SEQ=Seq[m p t] SEQ -> Span[L=SEQ Chunk[Span[Length[2] Run[Same L]]]]] ; Seq[u r i k] -> u u r r i i k k]


Whenever the model finds one thing, it should go looking for "more like that".

When the Old World has been Chunked, it's time to see if the New World can be Chunked the same way.


We have variables for what's the same, and we need variables for what's different.
Whenever we see the same thing in multiple places, we chunk them all, either by making a Chunk for each one or by making one
chunk for the whole and putting in a variable for the recurring thing.

 Span[Length[2] Run[Same m]]   Span[Length[2] Run[Same p]]   Span[Length[2] Run[Same t]]  
 what's the same: Span[Length[2] Run[Same L]]
 what's different: L
 Span[L=Seq[m p t] Chunk[Span[Length[2] Run[Same L]]]]   Span containing a repeated Chunk



Span = A description of a span of cells. Span[L=Seq[a b c] Chunk[...]] means "repeat the Chunk for each value of L".
Seq = a sequence of items that could each consecutively fill a variable
Chunk = a scope for variables; contains something that could occur more than once (with different values for the variables)
   Chunk[SEQ=Seq[a b c] SEQ SEQ]] means 'abcabc', i.e. no loop, only generate one Chunk.

Only a Chunk can have variables that get substituted. A Span may have them only when it's inside a Chunk.

. . .  skipping steps to represent the New World

NewWorld = Span[Length[1] Run[Same s]] o Span[Length[3] Same[s]] -> Span[]
   The Span/Run of length 1 must be pressured into existence; otherwise we'd just call it an 's'.
NewWorld = Chunk[L=s lspan o rspan ; Span[]]


"There's another OldWorld over there." "There's another left-side-of-this-chunk over there." Ignore variables; "squint".
There's something there that answers to this description. Don't worry about what's inside, just check the type. Or check
just a feature or two (the type and one or two things, like the presence or predominance of a certain letter).

The fewer variables we can bind, the better. Then matches don't have to be so precise.


Simpler to represent this with Run/Replace?


Can we have an ability in the model to look at something and answer the question "How do I find this element?"
E.g. in the context 'eeeeqee', you can find the 'q' by looking for "the odd letter"; you can find 'e' by looking for
"the predominant letter" or "the letter in Run[Same _]".

OldWorld = predominant-letter odd-letter predominant-letter -> predominant-letter Succ[odd-letter] predominant-letter

Instead of variables, should we have "how to find things"? "Indexical variables"?
For every "there" (a pointer), can we make a "how to find there" from some other location?
"The Span with the Skip". "The Span with the 'a'".


Old-lhs = Chunk[chunk[4, L] q chunk[2, L]]    <--- IDEA let's look at this later


Should it become easier to notice the Span-letter-Span structure in the rhs after noticing it in the lhs?

How can we refer to "the odd letter"? Whatever stands out as a "letter" in some context.
Hypothesis: Maybe you can only speak of an "odd letter" in relation to a Run, i.e. a regularity.
