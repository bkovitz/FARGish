Hypothesis: Two complementary directions of human thought:

   1. Keeping the search space small. Advancing one small step at a time, each
   step going to a well defined finish line. Varying only a little at a time
   (hence the small search space). "Targeted, systematic search"

   2. Dealing with many, many variables and hazy, undefined things all at once,
   letting some simplicity emerge without predefining it. "Hazy search;
   searching without knowing exactly what you're looking for."

The hypothesis is that both of these are necessary.

Targeted search requires conceptual order before it can start. Untargeted search
produces conceptual order. Targeted search seeks a goal known beforehand.
Untargeted search seeks coherence.

Art is mostly untargeted search. Art done by targeted search comes out clunky.
Art is discovery.
