In real life, analogies enable you to blend past experience with ad hoc
adjustment to the present situation.

If you run the wind-up toy that goes X->Y, in the WZ domain, it maps W->Z. 

The wind-up toy orients by certain cues in the XY domain, and different cues
in the WZ domain. There is a mapping between the appropriate orientation cues
in the two domains.
