A failed attempt at dividing graph.rkt into units, with the intention
of doing the same to numbo0.rkt. Obstacle: struct-copy doesn't work
inside a unit unless the struct is defined in the same unit. This
could be gotten around, but it's tough to say whether the benefits
of units would make up for nuisances like this one and whatever unknown
ones await.
