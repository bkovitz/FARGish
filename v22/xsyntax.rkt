;Main ideas:
;  Define stateful elements with t0 and t+1.
;  Refer to other state variables.
;  Return a list of actions?
;  Macro-expand these into functions that generic code can call one at a time.

; "eval" the 'find, get a list of actions?

; Could we do all this with ports and edges?
; name  is a port
; candidate  is a neighbor of name
; follow-up-definition  is a port
; follow-up  is a neighbor of follow-up-definition
; promisingness   is a function

; A path:
'((search-item eqn) * promisingness)
'((search-item eqn) * promisingness min)
'((search-item 5â€²) * follow-up)   ; an internal path?
; No good. The scout needs its own estimate of promisingness for each
; search-item. A candidate node's intrinsic promisingness, if any, probably
; won't be relevant.

; Could a node's attrs be free variables as in Racket's classes?
