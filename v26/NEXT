    NEXT The current problem is that 'same' across dups in a canvas tends
    to lock in a bad move. Solution to try: Wider canvas, so that 2 + 3 = 5
    becomes:

               2 * 3 = 6
               2 + 4 = 5
               2 + 3 = 5   <-- central canvas
               2 + 2 = 4
               1 + 3 = 4
               3 + 3 = 6
