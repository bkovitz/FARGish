v26 of FARGish: do nearly everything by regenerative memory


RMem.py
   Generic classes and mix-ins for regenerative memory (RMem) and canvases.

Numbo1.py
   Trying to build Numbo top-down from "big" codelets that "see and paint",
   and maybe later figure out how to get those big codelets out of the tiny
   painters of regenerative memory.

Grid.py
   An experiment with regenerative memory where the canvas is an 8x8 grid and
   the painters are movable 2x2 grids.
