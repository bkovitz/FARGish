It would be nice to have these features in Racket. Maybe they're already in
there, or maybe some are very easy to add.


make-hash should create an immutable hash.

DrRacket shows number of successfully completed tests even when no tests fail.

let-values should allow a dot:
  (let-values ([(a . d)] (values 1 2 3 4))
    a) => 1
