; First scout searches slipnet for equations. sk: run 2nd scout

; Second scout runs the splicing process. Starts scouts for the bind-tos,
; then starts scouts to bind/build from the equation nodes. sk: make the
; built nodes permanent.

; Bind/build scouts build if they can't find a mate.

; The 'bind nodes start more scouts: for neighbor-bindings.


; How do we break this into small, testable pieces?
;   mk-make-initial-archetypes
;   Test against list of actions without running them.

; The splicing scout needs to make its own desideratum:

'(all-or-nothing
   (bind (from '4+5=9) (to 'ws)
     (bind-to 15' (in-role result))  ; how do we bend on this?
     (bind-to 4' (in-role operand))
     (bind-to 5' (in-role operand))

     (bind-or-build-from +)
     (bind-or-build-from 4)
     (bind-or-build-from 5)))

; Promisingness might be able to guide releasing one or more desiderata
; from 'all-or-nothing. The support network could do that: if the rest of
; the system favors some of the bindings, we could accept an imperfect
; splice. A simple solution: if at least one bind-to is fulfilled and
; all the preimage nodes are bound to a mate, then declare victory.
